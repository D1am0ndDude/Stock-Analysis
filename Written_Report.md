# Stock-Analysis
## Purpose
We wanted Steve to run this code as efficient as we could. We know about Steves parents wanting to invest in Stock, and Steve, he is knowledgeable about it. In order to visually show his parents what stocks are best to invest in, and give an overveiw on how good the market did in 2017, and 2018, Steve needed a script. Something to do just that. At a push of a Button, Steve can show his parents what will work for them, and how good, or bad the stocks did. We made it very easy for them to make a decision on what to invest in. 

## Results
The parents first wanted to invest in DQ. That would've been a great choice in 2017. We can clearly see there was a 199.4% spike! But if they kept their money in that investment, they would've lost a lot of money. We can see a crash in the year 2018, dropping the return value to -62.6%! Well, what would be best for Steves parents? We can see there are two buisnesses that would be excellent for them to invest in. Both show no signs of declines. ENPH and Run!ENPH did amazing in 2017, at an outstanding 125.5%, and in 2018, it was still at a 81.9% high! Run didn't do too great in 2017, but it was not in the negatives. At 5.5%, Steves parents would still get a profit. If they kept that stock until 2018, Run would jump up by 84%! As a result, we see those two companies would be best for Steves parents to invest in.

Refactorying code has its advantages and disadvantages. What are the advantages? It makes the code more structured and Sustainable. It's the key purpose, since it makes it easier to restore and reorganize the code.It's more efficient to clean up the code earlier than wait to deal with errors in the code later. It also removes unnecessary variables, minimizing the conditions, getting rid of adoidable loops, and removing redundant code. This helps keep your code clean. Which not only benefits you, but it helps your team understand what you're doing. Lastly, it allows you to keep your code up to date. You do not want to use outdated code. 

What are the disadvantages? If you were to refactor code that has bugs in it, it will take more effort to resolve them. If your deadline is near, it's best just to fix any errors or bugs, and not refactor. If your code is stable, there is no need to refactor it.
